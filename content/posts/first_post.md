This is my first time using Hugo as a blogging framework. I used to have a little shared VPS equipped with WordPress, however, it doesn't last long, because I really don't have this particular habit to keep writing blogs or articles.

As a new starter in writing again, today I'll talk about my probation goal meeting.

Today is the second Friday since I joined my current company. My manager arranged my initial probation goal at this afternoon.

I'm not sure what is the standard to pass the probation period, but I have some personal goals I would like to achieve in this period.

First one is, of course, pass the probation period. No matter what is the standard process or requirement like KPI to pass the probation, I want to pass it.

Second one is more interesting, I'd like to work like a senior software engineer in the second half of my probation.

Third one would a performance or salary review.
